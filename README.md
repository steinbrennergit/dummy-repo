# MERN-PD

This is a project in continued development. Currently:
* Browse the first 151 Pokemon
* Select/click any of the Pokemon to view additional details (currently minimal)
* Select/click on an 'open' Pokemon to close it

Future:
* User authentication
* Save favorite Pokemon for easy retrieval later
* Animations

Known issues:
* CSS formatting of the 'additional details' is not yet mobile-responsive
